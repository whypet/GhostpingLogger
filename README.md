# GhostpingLogger - the bot that logs ghostpings
discord bot that logs ghostpings.



# how do work
it detects message edit and message delete events that previously had a mentionned user

# does this have a database?
no. this was originally made for siam alam's community and does not contain an SQL database
or anything similar. it only uses JSON for the bot's token and command prefix.

# what does this thing use
it uses DSharpPlus (latest version, compiled dll reference) for the bot to work.

# can i use it
yes of course just selfhost it or something it only works on one server because of no
database so you might need to host multiple.

# can i fork it
yes of course and if you do i'd recommend implementing an SQL database for it.

# programming language?
C#, Microsoft .NET Core
